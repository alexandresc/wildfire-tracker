# Wildfire Tracker made with React and NASA open api

This project was made possible with tutorial from youtube channel [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)

## It's dangerous to go alone, take your api keys with you

You need your own google maps api, edit the Map.js component and in bootstrapURLKeys insert your own googlemapsapi key

## Running the project

### `npm start`
